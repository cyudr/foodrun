## Deep-Dive Analysis & Fix Details

### ERR-01: Server 500 on Ingredient Identification & Routing Mismatch

#### Symptom:
When taking a photo or uploading an image, the client alerted:
```text
Could not identify ingredients: server returned 500. Make sure you are not routing through server.ts, route through /api/gemini.ts instead
```

#### Root Cause:
1. The client was previously falling back between `/api/gemini` and `/server.ts`.
2. When the dev server ran with Vite, requests to `/api/gemini.ts` were treated as static file requests or unhandled paths by Vite's connect server, causing 404s or 500 internal errors.
3. The serverless route needed a Node SSR execution environment to parse POST request streams and run `@google/genai`.

#### Resolution:
Added a custom Vite plugin `serverlessApiPlugin` in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
function serverlessApiPlugin(): Plugin {
  return {
    name: 'serverless-api-plugin',
    configureServer(server) {
      server.middlewares.use(async (req, res, next) => {
        const url = req.url || '';
        if (url.startsWith('/api/gemini.ts') || url === '/api/gemini' || url.startsWith('/api/gemini/')) {
          try {
            const mod = await server.ssrLoadModule('/api/gemini.ts');
            return await mod.default(req, res);
          } catch (err: any) {
            console.error('[API gemini.ts error]:', err);
            res.statusCode = 500;
            res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
            return res.end(JSON.stringify({ error: err?.message || 'Server error' }));
          }
        }
        next();
      });
    },
  };
}
```

Updated client calls in `src/App.tsx` and `src/components/CameraScanner.tsx` to target `/api/gemini.ts` directly.

### ERR-02: Large Base64 Payload Overflow on Mobile Camera Snaps

#### Symptom:
Photos snapped on modern high-resolution phone cameras (12MP–48MP) resulted in requests stalling or failing with body limit errors.

#### Root Cause:
`canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg')` without dimension constraints converted full 4000x3000 video frames into multi-megabyte base64 strings, exceeding HTTP body parsing thresholds.

#### Resolution:
Added canvas image resizing in `CameraScanner.tsx` for both live camera capture and gallery uploads:

```typescript
// In capturePhoto:
const maxDim = 1280;
let targetW = width;
let targetH = height;
if (targetW > maxDim || targetH > maxDim) {
  if (targetW > targetH) {
    targetH = Math.round((targetH * maxDim) / targetW);
    targetW = maxDim;
  } else {
    targetW = Math.round((targetW * maxDim) / targetH);
    targetH = maxDim;
  }
}
canvas.width = targetW;
canvas.height = targetH;
// draw and compress with quality 0.82
const dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.82);
```

### ERR-03: Video Stream Delay / Only Rendering After Camera Flip

#### Symptom:
Upon opening the camera, the viewfinder displayed a black screen. Live video only appeared once the user clicked the "Flip Camera" button.

#### Root Cause:
1. The `<video>` element was conditionally mounted in JSX only when `cameraActive` was true, creating a race condition between `stream` state updates and DOM node mounting.
2. The initial camera constraint used strict deviceId constraints before the browser had granted permissions, selecting a secondary or inactive camera index.

#### Resolution:
1. Kept the `<video>` element permanently rendered in the DOM with a CSS `hidden`/`block` toggle so `videoRef.current` is never null.
2. Added an explicit `useEffect` to attach `video.srcObject = stream` and invoke `video.play()` immediately when `stream` updates:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (videoRef.current && stream && cameraActive) {
    if (videoRef.current.srcObject !== stream) {
      videoRef.current.srcObject = stream;
    }
    videoRef.current.play().catch((err) => {
      console.warn('Video playback error:', err);
    });
  }
}, [stream, cameraActive]);
```
3. Prioritized `facingMode: { ideal: 'environment' }` with a broad fallback to ensure the primary rear camera connects immediately on first tap.

### ERR-04: Viewfinder Size and Standby User Experience

#### Symptom:
The live camera container consumed excessive vertical screen real estate, pushing user controls and recipe actions off the bottom of the screen. When the camera was off, the box was an empty black rectangle.

#### Root Cause:
The camera container had `h-[500px]` or `aspect-[3/4]` sizing without max-height constraints, and lacked an idle visual design.

#### Resolution:
1. Constrained viewfinder height to `h-64 sm:h-72 max-w-md mx-auto` with rounded corners (`rounded-2xl`).
2. Added a standby view featuring a curated culinary image with a subtle dark gradient, a "Camera Standby" pill badge, and an actionable **"Initialise Camera"** button:
```tsx
{!cameraActive && !previewImage && (
  <div className="relative w-full h-full group overflow-hidden">
    <img
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540420773420-3366772f4999?auto=format&fit=crop&w=1200&q=80"
      alt="Fresh culinary ingredients standby"
      className="w-full h-full object-cover filter brightness-[0.65] contrast-[1.05]"
    />
    <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-stone-950/90 via-stone-950/30 to-stone-950/60 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-3.5 text-center">
      {/* Standby Badge & Initialise Camera Button */}
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => startCamera('environment')}
        className="px-5 py-2.5 rounded-full bg-gradient-to-tr from-amber-500 to-orange-500 text-white font-extrabold text-sm shadow-xl"
      >
        <Camera className="w-4 h-4 stroke-[2.2]" />
        <span>Initialise Camera</span>
      </button>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### ERR-05: Unwanted Camera Auto-Start

#### Symptom:
Navigating to the Scanner tab immediately triggered the browser's camera permission prompt and activated the camera stream without explicit user action.

#### Root Cause:
`App.tsx` passed `autoStart={true}`, and `CameraScanner.tsx` had an effect:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoStart && !cameraActive && !previewImage && !cameraError) {
    startCamera('environment');
  }
}, [autoStart]);
```

#### Resolution:
1. Removed `autoStart` prop and the automated `useEffect` completely.
2. The camera now remains strictly dormant until the user explicitly taps **"Initialise Camera"**.

---

### ERR-06: Git Push Remote Authentication

#### Symptom:
Running `git push origin main` failed with:
```text
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address
```

#### Root Cause:
The environment lacks interactive TTY login and had no GitHub Personal Access Token or SSH keys configured.

#### Resolution:
Pushed using HTTPS authentication with the user-provided Personal Access Token:
```bash
git push https://<GITHUB_PAT>@github.com/cyudr/foodrun.git main
```
Result: All commits successfully synchronized with GitHub `origin/main`.

---

### ERR-09: "Choose Photo" Opens Camera App Instead of Photos

#### Symptom:
When clicking the "Choose Photo" button on mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome), the browser immediately opened the device's camera app/viewfinder rather than presenting the user's photo gallery, camera roll, or photo library.

#### Root Cause:
The underlying file input element was defined as:
```html
<input
  ref={fileInputRef}
  type="file"
  accept="image/*"
  capture="environment"
  className="hidden"
  onChange={handleFileChange}
/>
```
In the W3C HTML Media Capture standard, the presence of the `capture="environment"` attribute specifies that the user agent should directly invoke capture via the outward-facing camera device rather than opening the system file or photo chooser.

#### Resolution:
Removed the `capture="environment"` attribute and provided explicit image mime-types:
```html
<input
  ref={fileInputRef}
  type="file"
  accept="image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,image/heic,image/heif,image/*"
  className="hidden"
  onChange={handleFileChange}
/>
```
Now, clicking "Choose Photo" triggers the native system photo library and album picker as expected.

### ERR-10: Selected Photo Fails to Load for Detection (HEIC & Memory Stall)

#### Symptom:
Users were able to select an existing photo from their gallery/library, but the photo would not load for detection or would freeze with no visual feedback.

#### Root Cause:
1. **HEIC/HEIF Encoding**: Photos taken on Apple devices (iPhones/iPads) are saved in HEIC format by default. Native Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, non-Safari or webviews) cannot directly decode HEIC blobs into `<canvas>` or `Image()` objects without conversion.
2. **Memory Overload & Silent Promise Hang**: Large raw camera files (15MB - 30MB) passed to `FileReader.readAsDataURL` consumed excessive memory, and images without explicit `onerror` and timeout fallbacks stalled the execution pipeline indefinitely.
3. **Empty Processor File**: During previous server error, `src/utils/imageProcessor.ts` was left empty (0 bytes), resulting in missing function definitions.

#### Resolution:
1. Created robust `src/utils/imageProcessor.ts` featuring:
   - Dynamic conversion of HEIC/HEIF files via `heic2any`.
   - Rapid blob URL handling using `URL.createObjectURL(file)`.
   - Explicit `onload`, `onerror`, and 15-second timeout protections.
   - Intelligent canvas downsampling (max dimension 1280px) to output high-quality, lightweight (~200KB) JPEG data URLs.
2. Updated `CameraScanner.tsx` with immediate loading spinners, retake/clear buttons, and graceful error alerts.

### ERR-11: Reverse-Engineering & Dish Photo Dynamic Routing

#### Symptom:
Need to distinguish between raw pantry ingredient photos and finished plated dishes, deconstruct restaurant recipes with secrets, and adjust dish photography according to pantry ingredients.

#### Root Cause:
The API previously only supported basic raw ingredient listing and cycled through 6 hardcoded fallback images regardless of the actual recipe or pantry composition.

#### Resolution:
1. Enhanced `api/gemini.ts` with `handleReverseEngineerRecipe` and `handleAdjustDishPhoto`.
2. Created `src/utils/dishPhotos.ts` providing an intelligent culinary photo registry matching recipes to styles like Rustic Bistro, Michelin Star Minimalist, and Cozy Homestyle.
3. Implemented `ChefProModal.tsx`, `ReverseEngineerModal.tsx`, and `AdjustDishPhotoModal.tsx` for full premium feature experience.

### ERR-12: Multilingual Speech Synthesis & Recognition Accent/Prompt Mismatch

#### Symptom:
When switching language to Chinese, Malay, Korean, Tamil, or Japanese, the voice assistant continued to read in an English accent or failed to pronounce localized text properly, speech recognition failed to understand non-English commands, and recipe generation returned English text.

#### Root Cause:
1. `speech.ts` had hardcoded `utterance.lang = 'en-US'` and only selected English voice profiles.
2. `SpeechRecognition` was hardcoded to `en-US` and the command parser only checked English strings (`next`, `back`, `repeat`, `timer`, `stop`).
3. `api/gemini.ts` prompts lacked explicit language directives, causing Gemini to default to English outputs.

#### Resolution:
1. Built `src/utils/i18n.ts` defining language metadata, BCP-47 tags (`zh-CN`, `ms-MY`, `ko-KR`, `ta-IN`, `ja-JP`, `en-US`), and localized voice prompts.
2. Updated `SpeechController.speak()` to dynamically filter voices by language prefix and assign natural pronunciation models.
3. Enhanced speech recognition with multilingual voice command dictionaries recognizing hands-free commands in all 6 languages.
4. Added `getLanguageInstruction()` in `api/gemini.ts` ensuring recipes, ingredients, and reverse-engineered dishes are generated natively in the chosen language.

### ERR-13: Chef Pro Free Demo Pass Ungated / Need Environment-Based Invitation Code

#### Symptom:
Chef Pro features could be activated by anyone via a single click on "Activate Chef Pro Pass", bypassing invitation gating. The feature needed to require an invitation code matching environment variables with names starting with `vibe_`.

#### Root Cause:
The Pro status was managed purely via a client-side boolean toggle in `ChefProModal.tsx` and lacked a server-side verification barrier against environment secrets.

#### Resolution:
1. Implemented `handleVerifyInviteCode()` in `api/gemini.ts` (`action: "verify-invite-code"`).
2. Scans `process.env` dynamically for all environment keys starting with `vibe_` or `VIBE_` and case-insensitively compares the input against variable values, keys, and suffix names.
3. Added sample invitation codes to `.env.example` and `.env` (`VIBE_CHEF="CHEF2026"`, `VIBE_VIP="VIPCHEF"`, `VIBE_EARLY_ACCESS="VIBECOOK"`).
4. Redesigned `ChefProModal.tsx` with an Invitation Code input field, real-time verification feedback, error handling, and verified pass badge.

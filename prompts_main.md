## Detailed Prompt Breakdown

### Prompt 1: Initial Application Build
- **User Request:**  
  *Build an AI cooking and recipe assistant app that allows users to snap ingredients via camera or upload food photos, detect ingredients via Gemini Vision, recommend practical recipes with matching percentages, and provide a voice cooking assistant with step-by-step guidance.*
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Responsive mobile-first React SPA with Tailwind CSS.
  - Multi-tab navigation: Scanner (`scanner`), Pantry Review (`pantry`), Recipe Recommendations (`recipes`), and Favorites (`favorites`).
  - Interactive cooking modal with voice synthesis (TTS) and cooking timers.
  - LocalStorage persistence for user pantry items and saved favorite recipes.

---

### Prompt 2: Pure Gemini AI Routing & Multi-Zoom Controls
- **User Request:**  
  *Route all vision and recipes through `/api/gemini`, remove MealDB, add camera zooms.*
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Completely decommissioned static 3rd-party database dependencies (TheMealDB API).
  - Migrated recipe discovery to dynamic Gemini prompts producing matching percentages, dietary tags, and step-by-step instructions.
  - Implemented 1x, 1.5x, 2x, and 3x hardware and digital zoom presets in the camera scanner.

---

### Prompt 3: Main Camera Selection, Pinch-to-Zoom & Key Monitor
- **User Request:**  
  *Fix image analysis fallback, enforce main wide camera, add pinch-to-zoom and key status.*
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Added camera enumeration prioritizing the primary rear 1x wide-angle camera (avoiding ultra-wide 0.5x, telephoto, or macro cameras by default).
  - Implemented multi-touch pinch gesture (`handleTouchStart`, `handleTouchMove`, `handleTouchEnd`) with dynamic zoom multiplier calculation and on-screen zoom badge.
  - Added Gemini API key status check and diagnostic endpoint.

---

### Prompt 4: Direct `/api/gemini.ts` Serverless Path
- **User Request:**  
  *Route camera and photo data via `/api/gemini.ts`, auto-open camera on center button and viewfinder icon.*
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Pointed client HTTP POST requests directly to `/api/gemini.ts` across image analysis, recipe matching, and custom recipe generation.
  - Configured center bottom tab bar button to navigate directly to the camera scanner.

---

### Prompt 5: Server 500 Resolution & Middleware Unification
- **User Request:**  
  *Could not identify ingredients: server returned 500. Make sure you are not routing through server.ts, route through /api/gemini.ts instead.*
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Diagnosed that in Vite dev mode, requests hitting `/api/gemini.ts` failed because the Vite server lacked an SSR runner middleware for TypeScript API endpoints.
  - Created `serverlessApiPlugin` in `vite.config.ts` using `server.ssrLoadModule('/api/gemini.ts')` to handle API requests directly inside Vite dev server.
  - Added automatic canvas image downsampling (max dimension 1280px) and JPEG compression to eliminate payload size overflow.
  - Added resilient fallback cascade for Gemini models (`gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.8-flash`).

---

### Prompt 6: Viewfinder Sizing, Standby Graphic & Initialise Button

  - **Multilingual Voice Assistant (`src/utils/speech.ts` & `VoiceCookingAssistant.tsx`)**:
    * Dynamically configures Web Speech API synthesis with target language BCP-47 tags and preferred native voice models.
    * Configures `SpeechRecognition.lang` and multi-lingual voice command parser recognizing hands-free commands ("Next", "Back", "Repeat", "Timer", "Ingredients", "Stop") across all 6 languages.
    * Language switcher pill directly available in the cooking assistant header for seamless live adjustment.
  - **Multilingual Recipe Generation (`/api/gemini.ts`)**:
    * Updated `handleFindRecipes`, `handleCustomRecipe`, and `handleReverseEngineerRecipe` to accept `language` parameter.
    * Implemented strict Gemini prompts instructing generation of recipe titles, descriptions, categories, cooking steps, chef notes, and culinary measures entirely in the target language.
  - **Multilingual Ingredient Detection & Review (`IngredientReview.tsx`)**:
    * Directs Gemini Vision in `handleIdentify` to output ingredient names, state, culinary categories, and chef tips in the selected language.

- **User Request:**  
  *Put the try pro feature under invitation code, the codes need to match against environment variables with name starting with "vibe_"*
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - **Server-Side Code Verification Endpoint (`/api/gemini.ts`)**:
    * Added `handleVerifyInviteCode` endpoint (`action: "verify-invite-code"`).
    * Inspects `process.env` dynamically for all variables starting with `vibe_` or `VIBE_`.
    * Case-insensitively validates entered code against runtime environment variable values, variable names, and suffix identifiers.
  - **Redesigned Chef Pro Modal (`ChefProModal.tsx`)**:
    * Replaced one-click toggle with a secure Invitation Code entry portal.
    * Features instant verification with spinner state, clear error alerts, and success badge.
    * When unlocked, displays active Pro status with the verified pass name, and gives user control to deactivate or switch codes.
  - **Persistence & State Integration (`App.tsx`)**:
    * Integrates `isPro` and `proCode` state stored in `localStorage` (`snapchef_is_pro`, `snapchef_pro_code`).
    * Seamlessly protects reverse-engineering features, photo restyling, and Pro badge.

---

### Prompt 18: Pure Dynamic Environment Variable Sourcing (Zero Hardcoded Codes)
- **User Request:**  
  *Do not hardcore the vibe_ codes anywhere in codes, especially .env and .envexample, I will provide them through environment variables*
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - **Clean Codebase**: Removed all hardcoded fallback codes from `api/gemini.ts`, `.env.example`, and deleted `.env`.
  - **Strict Dynamic Validation**: `/api/gemini.ts` strictly queries `process.env` keys starting with `vibe_` or `VIBE_` injected at runtime by the user/host environment.
  - **Sanitized UI**: Removed code examples from input placeholders (`ChefProModal.tsx`), maintaining clean, secret-free frontend code.
